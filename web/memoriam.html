          Master Eric Heintz

          <br/><br/>
          <p>
         Sometimes at Two Rivers, you may hear the blackbelts refer to a Tae Kwon Do
         master  you've never met, and you don't know, Master Eric Heintz. Funny enough,
         he rarely had the opportunity himself to train with Two Rivers students, or
         even set foot into our dojang. Yet, Master Heintz's presence is strongly felt
         in all of us, as it is his example, both of training and character, that are
         the foundation of our school.
          <p>
         Master Heintz formed Eric Heintz Blackbelt Academy, leaving a successful legal
         career to focus on his passion for training in and teaching Tae Kwon Do. He,
         along with his wife Master Kaye Bair, grew the school. When illness forced
         Master Heintz to close his academy, a group of his senior blackbelts formed
         Two Rivers Martial Arts as a non-profit school, so they could continue teaching
         his style and philosophies.
          <p>
         I started training under Master Heintz in 1993.  I was a 19-year old kid,
         looking to bolster my self confidence and  wanting to find a place to make
         me tough enough to take on the adult world I was facing. In Master Heintz,
         I experienced this man who was strong and intense, and yet empathetic and
         caring. By the extraordinary example of his character  and by pushing me
         harder physically than I'd ever known before I began to see in myself some
         of the qualities he exemplified. Here are a few stand out qualities I
         remember about him and that still inspire me, and many others at Two Rivers today.
          <p>
         <span style="font-style: italic">
         Speak loudly without saying a word.</span> Master Heintz had an uncanny ability
         to express his intent through simply gazing at you. Most often you knew
         exactly what he was thinking simply by his look, whether he was complimentary
         or occasionally disapproving.
          <p>
         <span style="font-style: italic">
         Tae Kwon Do is about people.</span> Master Heintz was always interested in
         how you were doing both inside and outside the dojang. He truly cared
         about the people he surrounded himself with and always was gracious
         with his time. I can remember many occasions where I would come in to
         class early and stay after class late working on all sorts of things,
         no doubt keeping him from attending to other personal things. Yet, he
         would patiently work with me until finally gently reminding me that "he
         needs to go". When I went to college and would come back to class on
         breaks from school, he would ask me how school was and how I was faring.
         His caring is what created a family atmosphere at the school and what
         we have carried over to Two Rivers. Viewing our Tae Kwon Do school as
         one large extended family is very unique among martial arts schools and
         one of the reasons why we have a large number of very senior black belts
         that continue to be involved with the school to this day. 
          <p>
         <span style="font-style: italic">Strength is not about size.</span>
         Master Heintz had a very powerful presence
         while quiet in persona. Although not large in stature, he was physically
         strong and when necessary very intense. You need only to work with him
         for brief period of time to appreciate the intensity he possessed. There
         were many Friday night classes where we would be packed into the dojang
         and immediately when the lights were turned off, a hush fell over the
         students  all you could hear were his quiet steps while he was making his
         way to the front of the dojang. You could feel his presence; he commanded
         respect and rightly so. His physicality was legendary: leading twelve-plus
         hours long Tae Kwon Do classes, breaking thousands of board non-stop for
         charity, breaking boards blindfolded, competing in grueling tournament
         circuits. He practiced taekwondo with incredible passion and intensity and
         he demanded the same from his students.
           <p>
         <span style="font-style: italic">Believe in every individual's potential.</span>
         Master Heintz never turned a student away from his school; he always
         encouraged people to train. He believed in the potential that we all
         possess and strived to bring out the best in people regardless of their
         physical abilities, home life, or financial status. He was always willing
         to teach anyone, all they had to do was bring an open mind. I will never
         forget hearing him say that he always expected 100 percent out of everyone
         but that it's 100 percent of their
         <span style="font-style:italic">ability</span>. This was his way of acknowledging
         that everyone has different ability levels but can always be their
         <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline">
         own best</span>.  This is the training philosophy I live to today and hold
         my students to.
           <p>
         <span style="font-style: italic">
         Give to others.</span> Master Heintz was passionate about giving to causes
         higher than the individual. Every year, he collected Toys for Tots at all
         of our branches so that children could have a happy Christmas. Amanda the
         Panda was an especially important organization to him and he was committed
         to their mission of helping ease the grief of youth struggling with the loss
         of a loved one. He organized many fundraising activities that provided monetary
         assistance to Amanda the Panda. In fact, my first Tae Kwon Do demonstration
         was for Amanda the Panda when I was a yellow belt. I was scared to death but
         figured I must be okay if Master Heintz invited me to be there. We carry
         forward Master Heintz's commitment to give back at Two Rivers, often donating
         profits to good causes or hosting food drives and other fundraisers.
           <p>
         While I can't speak for every student of Master Heintz, I know that my
         sadness at losing him is eased by the lessons and qualities he shared with
         all of us. His legacy is reflected in many of our daily lives and Tae Kwon
         Do practice,  and in the core philosophies and practices of Two Rivers Martial
         Arts itself. I am proud to continue the traditions that he started and pass
         his legacy on.
          <p>
         You will not be forgotten Master Heintz. 
          <p>
