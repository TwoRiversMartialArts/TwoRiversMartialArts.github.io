Yoo-Sin

3rd Dan

Named after General Kim Yoo Sin, a commanding general during the Silla dynasty.  The 68 movements refer to the last two figures of 668 AD, the year Korea was unified.  The ready posture signifies a sword drawn to the right rather than the left side, symbolizing Yoo Sin’s mistake of following the king’s orders to fight with foreign forces against his own people.
