Koryo

Temp Black WTF 

Named after a Korean dynasty that lasted 457 years, from 935 AD through 1392 AD (between the Silla and Yi dynasties).  The name Korea is derived from the word Koryo.  During the Koryo Dynasty Korea was constantly having to defend itâ€™s borders.  The northern border was first invaded by nomadic tribes, then by the barbaric Mongols.  The people of Koryo defended their country from the Mongolian imperialists who had subjugated much of Asia.  The final threat to the Korean borders, during the Koryo Dynasty was frequent organized pirate raids by the Japanese.  Despite the turbulence, culture was a high priority during the Koryo Dynasty.  One of the most valued national treasures, the Tirpitika, is the carving of  the complete Buddhist canon onto 81,258 wooden blocks; which was carved as a pious gesture to secure divine favor against the Mongols.  Buddhist art was at its height but the greatest development in art was the unique greenish pottery glaze called celodon, which is still in use today.  Confucianism gave to the Korean culture not only Confucian schools, but also a system of civil service exams for government jobs.  Confucian and Buddhist Scriptures were in such demand, that by 1234 books were being printed on movable metal presses; about 200 years before Guttenburg.  Because the Koryo Dynasty was constantly at war but able to thrive culturally, the form, Koryo represents the cultivation of a strong conviction and an unrelenting spirit.
