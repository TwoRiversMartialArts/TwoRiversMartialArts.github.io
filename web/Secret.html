The Kobudo Secret

<Br>
<Br>
Since the modernization (and subsequent popularization) of Karate in the early 1900, Karate has spread to almost every part of the world. East to west, north to south. I even heard they have a Karate school in the North Pole. The training consists mostly of ice breaking.

No, that last was a lie. But there might be!

Now, with all of these Karate schools everywhere, the question I ask myself is this: How come Karate became so popular, spreading far and wide, but not Kobudo? Since, according to a noted Kobudo historian, Karate and Kobudo are like brother and sister, they should be equally popular.

Then why are they separated? Why is Kobudo almost neglected?

I thought I had the answer to this. I thought long and hard, and came up with five basic theories. They are all good. But, then somebody told me the real reason.

The one reason I didnt think about.

I will tell you that reason, of course, but first lets look at the five reasons I came up with.

1. Kobudo is hard

Generally, yes, Kobudo is hard. Especially for people who cant control their body. I mean, if they already have a hard time doing movements without an object in their hands, then doing it withsomething in their hands is sometimes too much for the brain. Overload.

And just when you think you are getting good at one weapon its time to switch to the next!

Complicated stuff doesnt get popular.

2. Kobudo is expensive

To practice Karate you need clothes. To practice Kobudo you need clothes. And a weapon. And depending on how advanced you are you might need more than one weapon.

If you are a black belt in Kobudo, you are likely to have two bo (one for kumite and one for kata), two sai, two tonfa, two nunchaku (one foam for kumite and one wood for kata), four kama (two wood for kumite and two steel for kata), two tekko, two eiku (kata/kumite) and sometimes more! This arsenal of weapons doesnt come for free. And if a weapon breaks, you need to buy a new!

Then you need covers for every weapon too…

Expensive stuff doesnt get popular.

3. Kobudo is “not physical enough”

This was the reply from a student who quit Kobudo. He just didnt get sweaty enough. Obviously he was doing something wrong, since Karate in full speed never can be as tough as Kobudo in full speed. I can prove it with a formula like this:

Body + weight in hands = more physical than Body – weight in hands.

Its simple. You see it, I see it. And still some people claim that Kobudo isnt as physical as Karate. Its not logic (we have formula) but they say it anyway.

I know why.

It’s because they are not on a high enough level to perform movements without risking hurting themselves. They are so afraid of the weapon itself that they cannot use it to 100 %. Hence, it becomes weak, slow, and boring Kobudo. Unless you actually train long enough to learn how to use 100% of the weapon without risking your neck.

A long, hard and repetitive process for learning fundamentals doesnt get popular.

4. Kobudo is for geeks

This one can be misunderstood, so let me explain: Geeks are often the opposite of people who do sports, right? And Kobudo is not a sport. So, logically, Kobudo must be for geeks, since you cannot compete in Kobudo.

Competition is popular.

Geeks dont get popular.

5. Kobudo is not practical

“So I was walking into the pub the other day, right, when this huuuge guy flipped out and came swinging at me. I quickly sidestepped, pulled up my sai from my back pocket and blocked his attack with my left sai, sticking the other into his throat. He puked blood and guts and died. I wiped the blood from my sai and ordered a beer.”

Not likely.

People just dont think Kobudo is practical. And sure, I agree that it doesn’t seem that way. But when you know the principles of the Kobudo weapons, you can use anything as a weapon – Shoes, purses, bags, belts, baskets, sticks, guitars and other random stuff in your environment. The unique shapes of the Kobudo weapons make you adept at handling almost any object, irrespective of shape
