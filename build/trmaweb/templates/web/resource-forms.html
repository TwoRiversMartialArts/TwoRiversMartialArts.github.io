				(Ee Jang)<br />
				20 Movements</td>
			<td align="left" valign="top" width="60%">
				Lake: The second form represents the treasures and mysteries of the lake. This form should be performed with ease and fluidity. This is an uplifting, serene and gentle form that should be performed forcefully but not aggressively. This form represents an awareness of your limitations and your ability to overcome or live within them.</td>

			<td align="left" valign="top" width="20%">
				High Orange<br />
				8th Gup</td>
			<td align="left" valign="top" width="20%">

				(Sam Jang)<br />
				22 Movements</td>
			<td align="left" valign="top" width="60%">
				Fire: The third palgwe form represents the energy of fire or the sun. This form should be performed with warmth and enthusiasm. This form represents the characteristics of fire such as variety and passion. The movements should be executed with quick, rhythmic, unpredictable pace and styling.</td>
		</tr>

				24 movements</td>
			<td align="left" valign="top" width="60%">
				Thunder: The fourth form represents thunder (noise without substance) which is a powerful natural source that comes from the sky and is absorbed by the earth. This form should be performed with bravery and courage. This form contains movements that display calm composure and strong balance such as blocks in combination with strikes and front kicks that require you to use force but immediately recover into a back stance, the way a passing thunderstorm nourishes the earth.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="left" valign="top" width="20%">
				High Blue<br />
				4th Gup</td>
			<td align="left" valign="top" width="20%">

				(Oh Jang)<br />
				35 movements</td>
			<td align="left" valign="top" width="60%">
				Wind: The fifth palgwe form represents wind (substance without noise) which is a gentle force that can change directions and become destructive without warning. This form should be performed with movements that change from gentle to violent. The movements of this form are yielding yet penetrating, soothing yet destructive, invisible yet manifest. This form represents a humble state of mind which balances the contrasting elements of the wind, gentleness and power.</td>

				(Yook Jang)<br />
				19 Movements</td>
			<td align="left" valign="top" width="60%">
				Water: The sixth form represents the liquidity and formlessness of water. Water flows around and absorbs things. It never loses its form. This teaches us that hardships and difficulties can be overcome by maintaining the natural flow, movement and integrity of water. This set of movements should be performed as though every action is exactly what is called for to overcome a situation at a particular moment in time.</td>

				<b>Pal-Gwe Seven</b><br />
				(Chil Jang)<br />
				23 Movements</td>
			<td align="left" valign="top" width="60%">
				Mountain: The seventh form symbolizes the immovable mountain. This form is characterized by stability in which moving and stopping occur at the appropriate times and for the appropriate reasons. This pattern reflects the need to combine movement and non-movement in response to an attack. The stability of a mountain comes from structural soundness and a form that is noble and majestic.</td>

			<td align="left" valign="top" width="60%">
				Earth: The eighth palgwe form represents the earth from which all all things are born, mature and die. It represents the end of the beginning as the platform from which the next level of growth can take place. It is the end of the cycle that begins the new cycle of forms. It is from here that everything grows.</td>

Pal-Gwe is descriptive of a world made up of elements both conflicting and harmonious, i.e. sky and earth, light and dark, man and woman, and good and evil. These elements meet and depart from one another according to the laws of nature, always growing and developing.
