                                                To try out our club and the art of Tae Kwon Do,
                                                <a href="locations-trma.html">
                                                just come to a few classes</a>! There is no obligation or cost. If you prefer,
                                                you can watch a class, but we've found that students get a far better appreciation
                                                for what class is really like – and what they can really accomplish – if
                                                they actually take a class with us. The youngest age we recommend starting
                                                is 7 years old, but feel free to discuss options with an instructor. Our
                                                Tae Kwon Do classes include students of all ages, and we encourage families
                                                to train together. <!-- Some of our classes are restricted to ages 18 and above
                                                unless training with an adult family member, and we do have a class designed
                                                especially for younger students called Little Dragons, held in Indianola. -->

                                                <br> Our members vary from complete beginners at martial arts to advanced students
                                                who have trained in Tae Kwon Do for many years. Many students who began their
                                                training with the club have gone on to earn their black belts here, and have
                                                continued training with us for years afterwards.<br>

                                                <h2>
                                                        Your First Classes

                                                During your first few classes in particular, you will be exposed to an abundance of new information and new physical techniques.
                                                There's no need to get frustrated, however – no one is expected to learn
                                                or remember everything immediately. (In fact, everyone else in the club is
                                                still working on those same techniques!)
                                                <br>
                                                <br> Early in your training, you must often just imitate higher belts as best
                                                you can. Be open to this old way of learning, which is uncommon today, but
                                                which works especially well for physical techniques, at which proficiency
                                                comes only after many repetitions. And don't hesitate to ask questions of
                                                the instructor or other experienced students at appropriate times.
                                                <br>
                                                <br> For your first class, please try to show up 10–15 minutes before the scheduled
                                                starting time. Arriving early will give you an opportunity to meet the instructor,
                                                to go over basic class etiquette, and permit the instructor to learn of any
                                                special needs or medical issues you may have that may affect your training.

                                                        <br><p>Although any student who feels dehydrated or sick can get water
                                                        or sit down as needed. Classes generally run from 60 to 75 minutes
                                                        with a break in the middle to get a drink. Advanced students will
                                                        typically drink 3–4 liters of water the day of class – as well as
                                                        the day after! So make sure you have plenty of water the day of class. <br><br>

                                                        <br><p> We recommend that you not eat anything substantial for several hours
                                                        before class. We do a lot of abdominal exercises and jumping and
                                                        twisting motions in class, and you are likely to be much more comfortable
                                                        with an empty stomach. Some club members with mysterious internal
                                                        architecture have claimed to be able to eat a full meal at 5:30 before
                                                        a 7:00 class, but most of us need more time. <br><br>

                                                        are OK, but remember that you will be doing splits and high kicks,
                                                        so please wear shorts of appropriate length. Also, please do not

                                                        immediately come over to check on your condition and see what you
                                                        may need. As mentioned above, any student who feels he or she needs
                                                        to sit down or get water will be permitted to do so. If you ever
                                                        feel that a particular exercise will hurt you (for example, because
                                                        of an injury), substitute something similar that is safe for you.
                                                        Let the instructor know before class if you anticipate any problem. <br><br>

                                                        <p> Acquiring the skills of a proficient martial artist takes a long
                                                        time, and much of the true value of training comes not from mastering
                                                        a skill, but from being comfortable working on something you haven't
                                                        mastered. Much of the joy of Tae Kwon Do comes from learning skills
                                                        that may take a lifetime to master. So come to class not to master
                                                        a new skill quickly, but to enjoy the process of learning! <br><br>

                                                In the beginning, just focus on coming to class, trying hard, and enjoying
                                                the process of learning something that is not only mentally challenging,
                                                but physically challenging, too! <br><br>
