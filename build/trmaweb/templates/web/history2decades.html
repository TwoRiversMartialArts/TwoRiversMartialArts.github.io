                                        For 23 years Two Rivers Martial Arts has been an experiment in martial arts
                                        self-governance, a unique approach for a traditional Tae Kwon Do school.
                                        Two Rivers has no headmaster and no owner.  Instead, it is an IRS 501(c)(3)
                                        nonprofit corporation with all black belts as corporate members.  Authority
                                        and decision-making are shared and under the direction of a board of directors
                                        elected by all active black belt members.  Tasks and responsibilities are
                                        distributed among unpaid volunteer black belts who teach classes, run tests,
                                        manage finances, maintain inventory, make repairs, and all the other
                                        functions needed to run a martial arts school.  As described in the
                                        previous article, Two Rivers Martial Arts came to be because of a unique
                                        history traced back to the Eric Heintz Black Belt Academy and a group of
                                        black belts who simply wanted to continue training together when Master Eric Heintz retired.

                                        It has been almost a quarter century since Eric Heintz black
                                        belts sat in that dimly lit lobby and said, "Why not?”
                                        Today Two Rivers Martial Arts is alive and well.  We have had branches
                                        come and go.  We now have 7 branches located in central Iowa – Des Moines, 
                                        Carlisle, Indianola, Pleasant Hill, Waukee, West Des Moines/Clive, and
                                        Winterset.  We lost two of our original branches (Norwalk and Meredith
                                        Middle School) when enrollments dwindled and the instructors stopped
                                        teaching.  Other branches have come and gone – Easter Lake, Weeks
                                        Middle School and Iowa Methodist Hospital in Des Moines, and Monroe
                                        Elementary in Monroe, Iowa.  Black belts from our Bethany, Missouri
                                        branch opened schools in Trenton, Missouri, Lamoni, Iowa, and St. Joseph,
                                        Missouri.  In 2014, Grandmaster Jung directed those Missouri-based
                                        schools to form their own school, and our sister school, Heritage
                                        Tae Kwon Do Academy, was born.

                                        Since its inception, Two Rivers has developed a reputation as school
                                        with excellent instructors and a top quality, affordable programs.
                                        Some of Two Rivers’ accomplishments include:

                                                Having 192 students earn their black belts and promoting
                                                many black belts to higher dan rankings.  Two Rivers
                                                currently has 55 active black belts ranging from 1st dan
                                                through 8th dan.  Over the past five years prior to the
                                                corona virus pandemic, the school has had an average
                                                enrollment of 175 color belt students.

                                                Maintaining low prices.  Early on test fees for low blue belts 
                                                and below were raised by $5.00 to match the price paid by high 
                                                blue and brown belts, thus eliminating confusion over the 
                                                varying amount of test fees.  Family class fees rates were 
                                                adjusted so that each additional family member pays $5.00 less.  
                                                Class fees were increased by $5.00 a few years ago.  Still Two 
                                                Rivers’ prices continue to be about half what for-profit schools 
                                                charge and comparable to Parks and Recreation programs that provide 
                                                only two or three hours of class per week, not the daily class 
                                                opportunities at Two Rivers.

                                                belts, developed a self-defense program that is 
                                                simple and effective and designed so that if a

                                        Two Rivers Martial Arts was created so we could continue 
                                        to practice Tae Kwon Do as taught by Master Heintz and to 
                                        pass on what we've learned to the next generations of 
                                        martial artists.  Two Rivers has grown financially, from 
                                        scrimping by the first year to stability.  There is enough 
                                        income to pay the bills, support three permanent location, 
                                        and offer scholarships to students who otherwise could not 
                                        afford to train.  Annually scholarships total about $2,000 
                                        in foregone class and test fees.

                                       Some of the black belts and instructors were 
                                       interviewed to determine what is different 
                                       about Two Rivers Martial Arts.  They were 
                                       asked what is special about Two Rivers, what 
                                       are its advantages over a traditional for-profit 
                                       school, and what are the disadvantages.  The 
                                       highlights of those conversations include:
                                    </p>

                                        In one way or another, each black belt commented 
                                        that Two Rivers is special because it is run 
                                        by volunteers.  There is no profit motive, and 
                                        no one is teaching for a paycheck.  Instructors 
                                        teach because of their passion for Tae Kwon Do and 
                                        commitment to the school and to instill those traits 
                                        in students as they move up the ranks and become Two 
                                        Rivers black belts.

                                        A Two Rivers black belt is part of something bigger 
                                        than themselves.  A new black belt made this 
                                        observation explaining why he looked forward to 
                                        earning his black belt and joining our community 
                                        of black belts.  Black belts in traditional martial 
                                        arts schools may be proud of their schools and loyal 
                                        to their headmaster, but becoming a Two Rivers black 
                                        belt makes him or her a member of the corporation and 
                                        responsible for the continued success of the school.  
                                        The school is theirs to support and pass on to future 
                                        generations.

                                        Two Rivers black belts refer to each other as their 
                                        Tae Kwon Do family. It is a cohesive group held 
                                        together by friendship and commitment to continued 
                                        learning and sharing our martial art with new students.  
                                        The group is all inclusive, accepting anyone at any age 
                                        and any gender.  One does not have to be young and male 
                                        to succeed at Two Rivers.  Women and men are treated equally.  
                                        Those with handicaps are welcome and not discriminated against.  
                                        Young and old participate together learning the same skills and 
                                        the same intangibles that make martial artists special.  
                                        Whether a student is ten or sixty, they can earn the same 
                                        black belt.  The only advantage youngsters get are 
                                        smaller boards.

                                        Two Rivers has three grandmasters, four active master black 
                                        belts, four retired masters, and one deceased master.  
                                        Their Tae Kwon Do experience ranges from 35 years to 22 years.  
                                        Two Rivers’ grandmasters and masters actively train with color 
                                        belt students, something that is much less likely at a for-profit 
                                        school run by one head master who teaches all the time.

                                        Two Rivers is not a black belt mill.  The senior black belts 
                                        work to maintain the high standards they learned at the Eric 
                                        Heintz Black Belt Academy and pass those standards along to 
                                        upcoming black belts.  Instructors are generally frank and 
                                        candid with students, telling them the truth about their progress 
                                        rather than sugarcoating it.  Instructors are supportive and do 
                                        not put down students for their shortcomings.  They let students 
                                        know they are expected to do their best, at the same time knowing 
                                        their students can accomplish more than they think they can.  Two 
                                        Rivers black belts know they have earned the right to wear a 
                                        black belt.

                                        Board members, instructors, and black belts focus on what is best 
                                        for the school, usually keeping their personal goals secondary to 
                                        what is good for the school.

                                        Since no one individual owns and 
                                        directs Two Rivers, it has the possibility of being “immortal.”  
                                        As instructors and board members age and retire from Tae Kwon Do, 
                                        younger black belts can step forward and continue running Two 
                                        Rivers.  The organization continues even as individuals come and go.

                                        </span>:
                                        In for-profit schools with a single headmaster, the owners 
                                        handle both the business and teaching duties, splitting their 
                                        time, energy and focus across all responsibilities.  Two Rivers’ 
                                        board of directors takes care of running the school as a business, 
                                        and for the most part instructors focus on training their 
                                        students in traditional Tae Kwon Do with minimal interference 
                                        from the business side.  While instructors may collect class 
                                        fees and sell uniforms, they do not have to worry about paying 
                                        bills, marketing and bringing in new students, filing forms with 
                                        the state and federal government, buying insurance, maintaining 
                                        inventory, and all those other responsibilities that go with 
                                        running a business.

                                        The governing board has a much broader range of experience

                                        Two Rivers board members’ backgrounds have included:  an 
                                        MBA who is the chief financial officer for an area

                                        The normative standard is that black belts and instructors will

                                        agree with a decision.   The school’s founders created the 
                                        expectation that all will go along with what the Board decides, 
                                        and this shared agreement is passed along to each new generation 
                                        of black belts.  Without that agreement dissention and 
                                        unwillingness to cooperate would develop.

                                        All black belts and students are welcome to attend Board meetings 
                                        and introduce ideas.  They can ask the Board to consider their 
                                        proposal, and while the Board may not accept the idea, it is 
                                        listened to seriously.  A traditional school run by a single 
                                        headmaster is not likely to have that openness and acceptance; 
                                        students most likely feel they should not suggest how the school 
                                        could be run or improved.  When the Board meets, board members 
                                        “leave their belts at the door,” meaning that each Board member’s 
                                        ideas and opinions will be respected.  Each member has one vote

                                                Two Rivers instructors are unpaid volunteers.  
                                                If they were paid, then bad feelings among 
                                                instructors could develop if all were paid an 
                                                equal amount.  Those with many more students 
                                                would generate much more in class and test fees 
                                                but not be rewarded comparably.  Conversely, if 
                                                instructors were paid on a per student basis,

                                        Decisions can take longer to make.  Issues must be 
                                        brought before board, discussed, and then voted on.  
                                        At a traditional martial arts school, a single head 
                                        instructor decides and moves on.  Some senior black 
                                        belts do lament not being able to just ask Master 
                                        Heintz and get an answer.

                                        No single charismatic leader
                                        </span>:
                                        The head instructor at a traditional martial arts school 
                                        tends to be a charismatic leader for the school.  Older 
                                        students fondly recall Master Heintz in this way.  Grandmaster 
                                        Jung is honored in that way by his students.  Two Rivers 
                                        has several masters, and while each is respected for his 
                                        or her skills and abilities, no one individual stands out 
                                        as the single leader.  Admiration is diluted as it is shared 
                                        among a number of black belts instead of being focused on one 
                                        individual.

                                        As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, the assets do not belong to the 
                                        black belts running the school and cannot be used for their 
                                        personal benefit.  Revenues must be used to achieve the 
                                        nonprofit’s purpose stated in its Articles of Incorporation 
                                        and By-Laws in order to maintain Two Rivers’ tax-exempt status.  
                                        Occasionally, black belts have wanted to give worthy individuals 
                                        money to help them through a tough financial situation.  That 
                                        is not permitted.  The owner of a for-profit school does not 
                                        have those restrictions and can spend revenues as he or she

                                        An individual dojang owner strives to make a profit.  His 
                                        livelihood depends on promoting the school and bringing in 
                                        new students, working long hours to make the school a success, 
                                        and generally growing his bank account.  Unpaid volunteers do 
                                        not have a profit motivation, and it can be difficult to 
                                        convince volunteers to do the less desirable but necessary 
                                        tasks needed to run the school.  For example, volunteer 
                                        instructors want to teach class and interact with students 
                                        but can be difficult to persuade to report necessary data 
                                        and class roster information needed to run the business 
                                        side of the school.  Volunteers can be difficult to motivate 
                                        to implement changes, such as a new self-defense program, 
                                        when they are satisfied teaching the way they always have.  
                                        The for-profit school owner is willing to add new programs 
                                        if it brings in new students and increases revenue.

                                        </span>:
                                        The Board of Directors has tried to adhere to the notion 
                                        that each board member has an equal voice and equal vote.  
                                        It is important that all board members have an equal 
                                        opportunity to express their opinions and share their 
                                        expertise.  Tae Kwon Do is militaristic, and those of 
                                        higher rank expect deference.  With a difference of 
                                        opinion, the senior belt can be insulted by the upstart 
                                        junior belt’s impudence in putting forth his or her 
                                        conflicting opinion, or the junior belt may feel squashed 
                                        when their opinion is dismissed by the senior belt and 
                                        the discussion moves on.  In other instances, a junior 
                                        belt may disagree with a tradition, not understanding its 
                                        importance and relevance to the culture of the organization.  
                                        If they can argue persuasively, some valuable traditions can 
                                        be pushed to the side and lost.  Still, organizations evolve 
                                        and hopefully improve.  Bringing in new board members with 
                                        new ideas can promote growth and positive change.
