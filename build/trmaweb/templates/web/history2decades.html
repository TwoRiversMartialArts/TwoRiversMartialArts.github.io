                                        For 23 years Two Rivers Martial Arts has been an experiment in martial arts
                                        self-governance, a unique approach for a traditional Tae Kwon Do school.
                                        Two Rivers has no headmaster and no owner.  Instead, it is an IRS 501(c)(3)
                                        nonprofit corporation with all black belts as corporate members.  Authority
                                        and decision-making are shared and under the direction of a board of directors
                                        elected by all active black belt members.  Tasks and responsibilities are
                                        distributed among unpaid volunteer black belts who teach classes, run tests,
                                        manage finances, maintain inventory, make repairs, and all the other
                                        functions needed to run a martial arts school.  As described in the
                                        previous article, Two Rivers Martial Arts came to be because of a unique
                                        history traced back to the Eric Heintz Black Belt Academy and a group of
                                        black belts who simply wanted to continue training together when Master Eric Heintz retired.

                                        It has been almost a quarter century since Eric Heintz black
                                        belts sat in that dimly lit lobby and said, "Why not?”
                                        Today Two Rivers Martial Arts is alive and well.  We have had branches
                                        come and go.  We now have 7 branches located in central Iowa – Des Moines, 
                                        Carlisle, Indianola, Pleasant Hill, Waukee, West Des Moines/Clive, and
                                        Winterset.  We lost two of our original branches (Norwalk and Meredith
                                        Middle School) when enrollments dwindled and the instructors stopped
                                        teaching.  Other branches have come and gone – Easter Lake, Weeks
                                        Middle School and Iowa Methodist Hospital in Des Moines, and Monroe
                                        Elementary in Monroe, Iowa.  Black belts from our Bethany, Missouri
                                        branch opened schools in Trenton, Missouri, Lamoni, Iowa, and St. Joseph,
                                        Missouri.  In 2014, Grandmaster Jung directed those Missouri-based
                                        schools to form their own school, and our sister school, Heritage
                                        Tae Kwon Do Academy, was born.

                                        Since its inception, Two Rivers has developed a reputation as school
                                        with excellent instructors and a top quality, affordable programs.
                                        Some of Two Rivers’ accomplishments include:

                                                Having 192 students earn their black belts and promoting
                                                many black belts to higher dan rankings.  Two Rivers
                                                currently has 55 active black belts ranging from 1st dan
                                                through 8th dan.  Over the past five years prior to the
                                                corona virus pandemic, the school has had an average
                                                enrollment of 175 color belt students.

                                                Maintaining low prices.  Early on test fees for low blue belts 
                                                and below were raised by $5.00 to match the price paid by high 
                                                blue and brown belts, thus eliminating confusion over the 
                                                varying amount of test fees.  Family class fees rates were 
                                                adjusted so that each additional family member pays $5.00 less.  
                                                Class fees were increased by $5.00 a few years ago.  Still Two 
                                                Rivers’ prices continue to be about half what for-profit schools 
                                                charge and comparable to Parks and Recreation programs that provide 
                                                only two or three hours of class per week, not the daily class 
                                                opportunities at Two Rivers.
