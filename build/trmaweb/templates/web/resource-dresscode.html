<h3>
The following are the dress requirements for Two Rivers Martial Arts students and instructors.  
</h3>
<br/>
<br/>

<ol>
<li><span class="toplevel">Doboks:</span><span class="body">  Students will wear a 
white dobok with the Two Rivers logo while training.  Students will also have 
the option of wearing an Eric Heintz Black Belt Academy dobok or a plain white 
dobok with no logo.  A complete uniform and belt are to be worn when training. </span> 
  <ol>
  <li>
  When students begin training with Two Rivers, they may wear 
  appropriate workout clothing, such as t-shirts and sweat pants 
  (preferably without pockets).  Once they are committed to staying at 
  Two Rivers, they need to wear an appropriate uniform. 
  </li> 
  <li>When students transfer from another school, they may wear that 
  school&#8217;s dobok for a reasonable time until they decide they will continue 
  training with Two Rivers.  Then they will need to wear a Two Rivers dobok, 
  Eric Heintz dobok. 
  </li>
  <li> Women and girls will wear a t-shirt, tank top, sports bra or other 
  appropriate clothing under their dobok top.  Preferably the garments will be 
  white if visible.  For first Dan and higher a black undergarment is acceptable.

  <li> Men and boys will not wear t-shirts or other shirts under their dobok 
  tops.  Men may wear a plain white t-shirt with permission of their instructor.</li>

  <li> Permanent first dan and higher dan black belts may at their option

  to be securely attached. </li> 
  <li> Colored or other special doboks may be worn according to the standards 
  set for that group as approved by the Board of Directors.  For example, a 
  demonstration team might have its own dobok.</li>
  <li> Sweatbands, bandanas, hair ties, and hair clips are permitted as long 
  as they do not detract from appearance.  </li>
  <li> A white dobok, either with or without black trim, shall be worn
       for the Black Belt picture.</li>
  <li> The Black Belt Youth Group members may wear their Youth Group Doboks

       a consensus of the local Dojang instructors at most one class
       per week.</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li><span class="toplevel">Belts:</span><span class="body">  Students will wear

  belt or a black belt with Two Rivers Martial Arts embroidered on one end 
  and their name on the other end.  Both names are to be embroidered in Korean with gold thread.</li>

 wear jewelry when dressed in their doboks.  Exceptions are made for medic alert 
 bracelets, necklaces, or pendants and for wedding rings.  Students choosing to 
 wear their wedding rings are encouraged to wear only a wedding band because 
 diamond rings can cut a fellow student when sparring.  If a student wears a 
 wedding ring with a diamond, the diamond should be covered with tape to lessen 
 the chance of injury.  Pierced earrings should be removed if possible. </span>
</li>

barefoot or in martial arts shoes.  The martial arts shoes are to only be worn

  to do combination kicking or required to stand out of sparring at 
  the instructor&#8217;s discretion.  </li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li><span class="toplevel">Other:</span><span class="body">  Students should

  Students violating the dress code will be asked to correct the violation.  
  Students unwilling or unable to comply will be asked to change into their 
  street clothes and may watch class from the audience or leave.
