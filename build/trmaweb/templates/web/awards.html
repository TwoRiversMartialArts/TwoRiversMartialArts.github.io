                                      This award honors Master Eric Heintz.  Through the 1980s and 1990s,
                                    Master Heintz and his wife, Master Kaye Baer, ran the Eric Heintz
                                    Black Academy, teaching martial arts skills but also improving
                                    their students' lives in many ways.  In the process, Master Heintz
                                    grew a community of black belts that we call our "Tae Kwon Do family".
                                    With Master Heintz's retirement, some of those black belts formed Two
                                    Rivers Martial Arts with the mission of continuing to teach Tae Kwon
                                    Do as it was taught at the Eric Heintz Black Belt Academy and passing
                                    on the principles and traditions learned there.  This award is given
                                    to individuals who have supported Two Rivers in the spirit in which
                                    it was created.
