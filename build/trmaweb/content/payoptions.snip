                                        There are several options for paying class fees. Two Rivers recommends setting up a recurring payment using an online bill-pay
                                        service or another automated method. This helps instructors focus their time on teaching.
                                        When paying by mail or electronically, please include an account number or student
                                        names. See the

                                        number, provide feedback, or ask any questions. Your instructor can also obtain your
                                        account number from the Two Rivers treasurer. Options for payment:

                                        Class fee payments are due at the beginning of each month. Some students prefer to pay on a 2-month cycle aligning with our
                                        scheduled promotion tests, which works as well.
